							<h4>The Influence of Celestial Bodies</h4>
							<div class="text-left">
								<p></p><br/>
								<p>Jyothish is an ancient traditional Hindu system of astrology, and is one of the most time-tested and oldest systems in the world. The Sanskrit word ‘Jyotish’ (ja-yo-teesh) means ‘science of light.’ In the western world, it is also called Vedic astrology. The origins of Vedic astrology are in the Vedas — the ancient scriptures of Hindus. Vedic astrology is the science of understanding the influence of heavenly bodies on our life. The science of light is not the visible light, but light that enlightens the inner self; which minimizes uncertainty; which allows us to plan our future, to improve our odds in our favor and to reduce the risk of failure.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> When practiced correctly, Vedic astrology is an excellent tool within Sanatan Dharm and can help avoid pitfalls and take remedial action to achieve a smoother, balanced life, as we strive for material and spiritual progress.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Sanatan Dharm promotes harmony, encourages us to seek resonance with our surroundings, and teaches us that alignment between the individual and the forces of the universe is desirable. Through tools such as vastu, ayurved, numerology and jyotish, we align our vibrations with those of the universe for a happy, productive and an ideal life; and we seek perfection.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Spirituality is the basis of Vedic astrology and it is designed to reveal the inner person. Changing the inner person can also change his/her outer life. By studying the planets and their relationships, we can determine their influences on our well being, and consequently chart a path towards prosperity, health, happiness, and the ultimate goal — moksh.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Vedic astrology is unique in that it offers simple solutions to compensate for the influences of celestial bodies. Therapies include mantras, meditation, rituals, gems, and spiritual suggestions. Therefore like vastu and ayurved, Vedic astrology offers solutions to people so they can gain control over their life.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The astrologer uses Vedic astrology to chart the horoscope of an individual. It is said that a horoscope in your hands is a map of your destiny. The secrets contained in the horoscope can only be revealed by a Vedic astrologer. The birth-chart, or horoscope, is a symbolic representation of the Earth, planets, and stars at the time of one’s birth. It is a divine language, a mystic code by which God has communicated a person’s destiny, knowing which, a wise person will exercise his free will to optimize the result.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> At Shubh Consulting, we provide you with effective astrological solutions, and our remedies include use of gem stones and mantras which help you overcome obstacles in life with ease and achieve your goals in life.</p>

								<p></p><br/>
								<p>Vastu shastra is an ancient science that explains how the laws of nature affect human dwellings and states the rules for building a home that would ensure peace, prosperity and health of its residents. Its theories are based on the five elements — Water, Air, Fire, Earth and Space — and their effects on human life.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Vishwakarma Prakash, an ancient book of Vastu Shastra, lays down the basic rules of vastu and emphasizes on the importance of different vastu zones in a building. It asserts the fact that residents who perform activities in a household based on vastu rules, lead a life filled with peace and prosperity. It explains the significance of different vastu zones of a house and the corresponding aspects of life that they govern. Following is an overview of the significance of major vastu zones in a house: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->North: Domintaes the career and money aspects of your life. An ideal place for a living room. Nice to have green plants here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->North-East: Dominates the spiritual and psychological aspects of your life. The direction is ideal for mediation and Pooja based activities. Avoid having bedroom, toilets or a septic tank here. Keep your temple here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->East: Dominates your social life. Bedrooms, living rooms and study tables can be placed here. Its also good to have a garden here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->South-East: An ideal zone for a kitchen. Avoid water based activities here. This zone governs your zeal and enthusiasm for life.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->South: Dominates your fame and status in the society. Can be used as a bedroom. Head should be kept towards the south while sleeping. You may display your medals and awards here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->South-West: Dominates your family life. Ideal for a master bedroom. You can place family photographs placed here to improve harmony in your family.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->West: Dominates the Creative, Educational and Gain aspects of your life. Can be used as a bedroom or a living room. You may have your dining here too. You may display your artworks here. It is nice to have metal sculptures here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->North-West: An ideal zone for storage. Can also be used as a living room or a bedroom.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Vastu Sashtra also asserts that performing activities in a wrong zone of the house can have adverse affects on the residents, also called Vastu Dosh. These wrongly placed activities such as placement of toilets and stairs affect peace of mind, and hamper growth and prosperity of the residents. If you can relocate these activities to favorable zones, then you should do so. If you are unable to relocate these activities, there are ways to overcome their ill effects without structural demolition within the house.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> At Shubh Consulting, we provide simple and effective solutions without structural demolitions. We recommend use of metal wires and strips, tools such as pyramids and yantras, and color, sound and form energy, to help an individual realize his potential to the fullest and lead a life of peace and prosperity.</p>

							<h4>The Occult Significance of Numbers</h4>
							<div class="text-left">
								<p></p><br/>
								<p>Numerology is the study of the symbolism of numbers. It is used to determine a person’s personality, strengths and talents, obstacles, inner needs, emotional wellbeing, and compatibility with others. Whether you use numerology to examine your life, take advantage of unexplored opportunities, confirm your talents or simply figure out where to go next, numerology can be a penetrating tool that helps you understand your own self and your loved ones better. Numerology presents a complete picture, revealing all the diverse parts of your personality and how they come together to create the person you are. With this complete view, you will be able to make the most of your strengths and also identify areas of weakness that you need to strengthen.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Numerology is a branch of the divine science — Vedic astrology. Numerology deals with only nine basic numbers, from 1 to 9, each of which has its own significance. Given your date of birth, is it possible to calculate all important events from your your past, present and even the future. You can determine the personality or the character based on your birth number. You can even find out your lucky numbers, lucky days, lucky colors or lucky stones too!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> This is how Numerology works. Everything in the universe vibrates at its own frequency. By finding the vibration rate of any object, you can establish the qualities and energies associated with it. By applying the principles of numerology — and using only a name and birth date as the basic data — you can determine the dominating frequency of an individual. A numerological analysis of the calculated frequencies provides significant information on personality and character.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> At the core, all numbers are reduced to the single digits 1 through 9 except the special master numbers 11 and 22. 1 through 9, 11 and 22 represent the major vibration rates associated with people’s characteristics. The numbers are reduced by addition. The number 15, for instance, is reduced by adding 1 + 5 to get 6. Similarly, the number 1974 can be reduced by adding 1 + 9 + 7 + 4 to get 21. The 21 can be further reduced by adding 2 + 1 to get 3. Letters in individuals’ names are converted to numbers and then added together. These numbers, in turn, are also reduced until you get one of the basic numbers.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> At Shubh Consulting, we find out your favorable and unfavorable numbers, and guide you in attaining their maximum benefit.</p>
